## PassifyPlus
PassifyPlus was created to address the need for secure password management and encryption/decryption functionalities. In today's digital age, where online security is paramount, individuals and organizations require robust tools to generate strong passwords and encrypt sensitive data. PassifyPlus aims to provide a simple yet effective solution to these security concerns.

## Features
Password Generation: Users can generate strong and secure passwords with customizable options such as length and character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
Encryption/Decryption: Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using various algorithms including Caesar, Rail Fence, and Vigenere ciphers. This feature ensures that sensitive information remains protected during the transmission or storage of data.

## Tech Stack
PassifyPlus is built using Java and utilizes the Swing framework for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). 

## Database used
MySQL: I have integrated MySQL into PassifyPlus which enhances its functionality by providing a secure and scalable solution for storing user data and encrypted messages. This integration ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and reliability, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application.

## Future Scope
PassifyPlus could be improved by integrating more encryption algorithms, enhancing password generation with advanced options, and adding features for securely managing encrypted data. Additionally, introducing user authentication mechanisms would enhance security, ensuring access is restricted to authorized users for a more comprehensive and secure experience.
